 * -> locale-initial-batch -> configure -> locale-remaining-batch
 * -> finished -> done tasks, in this order, if you don't implement
 * this function in your profile.
 *
 * If this function is implemented, you can have any number of
 * custom tasks to perform after 'configure', implementing a state
 * machine here to walk the user through those tasks. First time,
 * this function gets called with $task set to 'profile', and you
 * can advance to further tasks by setting $task to your tasks'
 * identifiers, used as array keys in the hook_profile_task_list()
 * above. You must avoid the reserved tasks listed in
 * install_reserved_tasks(). If you implement your custom tasks,
 * this function will get called in every HTTP request (for form
 * processing, printing your information screens and so on) until
 * you advance to the 'profile-finished' task, with which you
 * hand control back to the installer. Each custom page you
 * return needs to provide a way to continue, such as a form
 * submission or a link. You should also set custom page titles.
 *
 * You should define the list of custom tasks you implement by
 * returning an array of them in hook_profile_task_list(), as these
 * show up in the list of tasks on the installer user interface.
 *
 * Remember that the user will be able to reload the pages multiple
 * times, so you might want to use variable_set() and variable_get()
 * to remember your data and control further processing, if $task
 * is insufficient. Should a profile want to display a form here,
 * it can; the form should set '#redirect' to FALSE, and rely on
 * an action in the submit handler, such as variable_set(), to
 * detect submission and proceed to further tasks. See the configuration
 * form handling code in install_tasks() for an example.
 *
 * Important: Any temporary variables should be removed using
 * variable_del() before advancing to the 'profile-finished' phase.
 *
 * @param $task
 *   The current $task of the install system. When hook_profile_tasks()
 *   is first called, this is 'profile'.
 * @param $url
 *   Complete URL to be used for a link or form action on a custom page,
 *   if providing any, to allow the user to proceed with the installation.
 *
 * @return
 *   An optional HTML string to display to the user. Only used if you
 *   modify the $task, otherwise discarded.
