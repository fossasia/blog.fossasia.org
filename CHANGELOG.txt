    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
- Added FAQ module
- Changed the "open submission queue" into a (optional) module.
- Various updates:
    * Improved account module:
        + User accounts can be deleted.
