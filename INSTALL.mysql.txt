CREATE THE MySQL DATABASE
--------------------------

This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database set-up (e.g. by
your host). In the following examples, 'username' is an example MySQL user which
has the CREATE and GRANT privileges. Use the appropriate user name for your
system.

First, you must create a new database for your Drupal site (here, 'databasename'
is the name of the new database):

  mysqladmin -u username -p create databasename

MySQL will prompt for the 'username' database password and then create the
initial database files. Next you must login and set the access database rights:

  mysql -u username -p

Again, you will be asked for the 'username' database password. At the MySQL
prompt, enter following command:

  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER,
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON databasename.*
  TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

where

 'databasename' is the name of your database
 'username@localhost' is the username of your MySQL account
 'password' is the password required for that username

Note: Unless your database user has all of the privileges listed above, you will
not be able to run Drupal.

If successful, MySQL will reply with:

  Query OK, 0 rows affected
