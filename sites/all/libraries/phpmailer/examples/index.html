This release of PHPMailer (v5.0.0) sets a new milestone in the development
cycle of PHPMailer. First, class.phpmailer.php has a small footprint (65.7 Kb),
while class.smtp.php is even smaller than before (at only 25.0 Kb).<br />
<br />
We have maintained all functionality and added Exception handling unique to
PHP 5/6.<br />
<br />
There is only one function that has been removed: that is getFile(). The reason
for this is that getFile() became a wrapper for the PHP function 'file_get_contents()'
and nothing more. Rather than burden the class with a function already available
in PHP, we decided to remove it.<br />
<br />
Our new Exception handling provides your own scripts far more power than ever.<br />
<br />
We have also enhanced the "packaging" of PHPMailer with an entirely new set of 
examples. Included are both basic and advanced examples showing how you can take
advantage of PHP Exception handling to improve your own scripts.<br />
<br />
A few things to note about PHPMailer:
<ul>
  <li>the use of $mail-&gt;AltBody is completely optional. If not used, PHPMailer
  will use the HTML text with htmlentities().<br />
  We also highly recommend using HTML2Text authored by Jon Abernathy. The class description
  and download can be viewed at: http://www.chuggnutt.com/html2text.php.
  </li>
  <li>there is no specific code to define image or attachment types ... that is handled
  automatically by PHPMailer when it parses the images</li>
</ul>
A note to users that want to use SMTP with PHPMailer. The most common problems are:
<ul>
  <li>wrong port ... most ISP (Internet Service Providers) will not allow relaying through
    their servers. If that's the case with your ISP, try using port 26.
  </li>
  <li>wrong authentication information (username and/or password) ... don't forget that
    many servers require the account name to be in the format of the full email address.
  </li>
  <li>... if these tips do not get your SMTP settings working, we have a debug mode
    for helping you determine the problem. Insert this after $mail->IsSMTP();<br />
    $mail->SMTPDebug  = 2;  // enables SMTP debug information (for testing)<br />
    note that a setting of 2 will display all errors and messages generated by the SMTP
    server<br />
  </li>
</ul>
Our examples all use an HTML file in the /examples folder. To see what the email SHOULD
look like in your HTML compatible email viewer: <a href="contents.html">click here</a><br>
