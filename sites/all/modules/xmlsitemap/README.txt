XML Sitemap automatically creates a sitemap that conforms to the sitemaps.org
specification. This helps search engines keep their search results up to date.


INSTALLING
----------

See http://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib for instructions on
how to install or update Drupal modules.

Once XML Sitemap is installed and enabled, you can adjust the settings for your
site's sitemap at admin/settings/xmlsitemap. Your can view your site's sitemap
at http://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml.

It is highly recommended that you have clean URLs enabled for this module.


UNINSTALLING
------------

Because Drupal does not uninstall modules in reverse order of their
dependencies, if you want to uninstall all the XML sitemap modules, be sure to
disable and uninstall all the sub-modules before the base XML sitemap module.
To help fix this bug in Drupal core, visit http://drupal.org/node/151452.
