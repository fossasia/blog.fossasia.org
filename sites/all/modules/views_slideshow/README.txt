Views Slideshow
===============

The Views Slideshow module is a Views Style Plugin that can be used to output
Views in a jQuery slideshow.

There are currently 2 modes:

SingleFrame

In SingleFrame mode slideshows are output as single elements and controls can be
displayed as numbered links or thumbnails of individual fields.

ThumbnailHover

In ThumbnailHover mode slideshows are output as node teasers or full nodes. The
controls for advancing the slideshow are nodes too.

Further details about each can be found within their respective directories.
