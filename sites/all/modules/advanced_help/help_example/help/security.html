<p>PHP is a popular target of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" title="Hacker">hackers</a> who exploit vulnerable applications written in PHP. Software vulnerabilities related to PHP are identified among the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures" title="Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures">CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</a> records, available from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vulnerability_Database" title="National Vulnerability Database">National Vulnerability Database</a>. The proportion of vulnerabilities related to PHP, out of the total of all common vulnerabilities, amounted to: 12% in 2003, 20% in 2004, 28% in 2005, 43% in 2006, 36% in 2007, and 33.8% for the first quarter of 2008. More than a quarter of all software vulnerabilities listed in this database are related to PHP, and more than a third of vulnerabilities listed recently. Most of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, that is without being logged on the computer hosting the vulnerable application.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> Such exploitation is made possible due to poor programming habits, such as failing to check data before entering it into a database, and features of the language such as <code>register_globals</code>, which is now deprecated.<sup id="cite_ref-register_globals_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-register_globals-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> These result in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection" title="Code injection">code injection</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" title="Cross-site scripting">cross-site scripting</a> and other <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_security" title="Application security">application security</a> issues. It's important to note that none of these attacks are exclusive to PHP and all are avoidable by following proper coding techniques and principles.</p>
