Attachment displays are 'attached' to another display in the same view. When the display is visited, the attached display will also be rendered and may be placed before, after or both before and after the original display. Attachment displays are often useful for displaying an argument summary view along with a page display that accepts arguments. This can be used to provide a kind of glossary.
