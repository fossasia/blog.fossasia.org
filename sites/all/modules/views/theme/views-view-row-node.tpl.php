 * @file views-view-row-node.tpl.php
 * Default simple view template to display a single node.
 *
 * Rather than doing anything with this particular template, it is more
 * efficient to use a variant of the node.tpl.php based upon the view,
 * which will be named node-view-VIEWNAME.tpl.php. This isn't actually
 * a views template, which is why it's not used here, but is a template
 * 'suggestion' given to the node template, and is used exactly
 * the same as any other variant of the node template file, such as
 * node-NODETYPE.tpl.php
 *
 * @ingroup views_templates
