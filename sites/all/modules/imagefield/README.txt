ImageField provides an "Image" widget type to CCK. This module leverages the
functionality of FileField and behaves nearly identically. ImageField widgets
will give you a nice thumbnail preview of the image when uploaded, and provides
a few display options (formatters) within CCK to display the images when the
content is viewed.

ImageField was written by Darrel Opry (dopry).
Maintained by Nathan Haug (quicksketch) and Andrew Morton (drewish).

Dependencies
------------
 * FileField
