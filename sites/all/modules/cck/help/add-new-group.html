<p>Field groups are used to visually gather several fields that are associated
by some sort of logic, for instance several text fields that hold the different
parts of an 'Address'. On input forms and displayed content, the corresponding
fields are enclosed inside an HTML fieldset.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the <strong>Manage fields</strong> page for a content type,
you'll find this:</p>

<p>In order to add a new group to a content type, you need to provide the
following information:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Label:</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    A human-readable name for the group. It will be used in input forms and
    on displayed content.<br/>
    All characters are allowed, including spaces, accentuated or non-european
    characters.<br/>
  </dd>

  <dt>Group name:</dt>
  <dd>
    A machine-readable name for the group. It is used internally to identify
    the group. When doing custom theming, it is this identifier that you'll use
    to refer to that group.<br/>
    <strong>Important:</strong> The group name cannot be changed once the group has been
    created.<br/>
    Allowed characters: a-z (unaccentuated), 0-9 and the underscore (_).<br/>
    The length of the group name cannot exceed 32 characters (including the
    'group_' prefix that gets added automatically - that is, 26 free characters)<br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
