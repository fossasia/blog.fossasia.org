Upgrading From imagecache version 1.x to 2.0
  -- Install ImageAPI before attempting to upgrade to imagecache 2.x. Your site will 'Blow UP' otherwise.
  
  -- The old ImageScale actions should be turned into Deprecated Scale actions. You
     should update your presets to use the new scale or 'scale and crop' actions.
